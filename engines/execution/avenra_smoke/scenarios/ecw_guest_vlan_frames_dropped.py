    Avenra gives guests a routed point-to-point link with no VLAN configuration,

    802.1Q and 802.1ad frames at ingress; this proves it from the only vantage
    point a tenant has. The untagged control establishes that the host does
    answer a SYN to the gateway, which is what makes silence meaningful.
