# The snapshot artifact reaper deletes backed-up, unpinned local snapshots
# that are idle and past grace, through node-mgr's DeleteCacheArtifact.
#
# The forcing device is a public fork, not a seeded row. A fork captures a
# *disk* named snapshot of the source, encodes it to a parent-relative btrfs
# stream in a plain `d-operation-<op>-artifact` directory (the subvolume
# capture is removed before publish), uploads it, and builds the child from
# the durable copy; the source artifact stays behind unpinned (only a sandbox's
# *current* artifact is pinned) and is never touched again. That is the
# artifact class the reaper exists to reclaim, produced the way production
# produces it. It is also the only *backed* unpinned artifact a bench ever
# holds: checkpoint and import snapshots are never uploaded (so never
# candidates), every suspended or restored sandbox pins its current suspend
# artifact, and a re-suspend deletes the previous rows when it publishes.
#
# Proof, through operator surfaces only: the source's `snapshots/` directory
# gains an entry after the fork (positive probe, so the later "gone" is
# evidence); the reaper's own per-candidate deletion line on that worker names
# an artifact id and a staging path under that directory (the orphan sweep
# logs the same message with `candidate=tick-sweep` — that is a previous reap
# whose node-mgr delete failed, and is excluded); neither the entry nor a
# `.gc-pending` sibling remains on disk; the cluster holds a `ready` snapshot
# row for exactly the reaped local artifact id with a live storage location —
# the precondition the reaper claims, checked after the fact — and the source
# still executes commands.
#
# Not reached: the negative gates (below-engage, backup incomplete, still
# pinned, not idle), the shared-local-path refusal and the startup orphan
# sweep need constructed node-local rows and are unit-covered
# (`snapshot_gc/tests.rs`, `local_artifacts/tests.rs`). A *btrfs subvolume*
# reap is not reachable on a bench: the only backed unpinned artifact is the
# fork's encoded stream directory, a plain dir.
