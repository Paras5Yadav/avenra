# Net-gateway fleet cycle

Use `scripts/netgtw/cycle-fleet.sh --context <ctx>` to preview stale gateways on
regular workers. Add `--node <node-name>` to inspect one node. The script is a
dry run unless `--execute` is supplied; `--refresh-config` selects live gateways
regardless of binary SHA and does not shrink its selection after a cycle.

Before creating a privileged per-node Job, an execute run previews the selection
through that node's sandbox-manager pod. An empty successful preview skips the
Job. A failed preview prints the original error, reports `no Job created`, and
marks the node's sweep failed. Resolve the preview failure before retrying; a
Job cannot repair a state-read failure in the same CLI. The CLI reads sandbox
state in bounded gRPC requests and splits a request further if its decoded
reply exceeds Tonic's limit. If one sandbox's state still exceeds the limit,
the preview fails without cycling any gateway.

For `--refresh-config`, the preview exports the selected IDs and the Job uses
those explicit IDs. `--export-ids <file>` saves a cohort without cycling; use
`--ids-file <file>` with `--node` to retry that exact cohort.

`node did not converge (phase=Failed)` reports the cycle Job pod phase. It does
not describe Kubernetes node health. Inspect the preceding Job logs to find
the actual failure.

## Protected control endpoint rollout

Sandbox-manager clients connect directly to the isolated gateway listener under
`/avenra/run/net-gateway/<sandbox-id>/control.sock`. The compatibility alias in
the sandbox-owned run directory remains for old clients, but new clients never
use it: a compromised sandbox-UID sidecar can replace that alias.

Deploy the isolation-capable runtime supervisor and node-manager first, then
cycle resident gateways using the preview and execute workflow above before
upgrading sandbox-manager clients. Use `--refresh-config` to include gateways
whose binary is current but whose live UID or socket layout is still legacy.
Already-isolated gateways work with both client versions; upgrading only the
gateway preserves old-client connectivity through the alias.

Upgrading clients before cycling shared-UID gateways fails closed with a
protected-endpoint error and a `avenra-sbxmgr cycle-net-gateway` recovery command.
Resident resume remains paused when its policy confirmation cannot connect;
policy reconciliation retries but cannot repair a legacy listener's location.
An operator must complete the gateway cycle. The client does not automatically
restart a live gateway or fall back to the sandbox-owned alias. Rolling clients
back restores old compatibility behavior, including its alias-spoofing exposure.
