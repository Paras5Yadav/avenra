# pull-base-images.sh — put every registry image the given Dockerfiles build
# FROM into the local image store before the build runs, retrying failed pulls.
#
# The Tiltfile runs this ahead of each `docker build`. Each Kind smoke shard
# starts every runtime image build at once, all resolving their bases as
# anonymous public.ecr.aws pulls, and on 2026-09-25 two consecutive main runs
# each lost a shard when one of those pulls got "429 Too Many Requests". A
# failed `docker build` cannot say whether the registry or the Dockerfile was
# at fault, so it cannot be retried safely. A failed `docker pull` of a named
# public image can only be the registry or the network, so every failure here
# is retried, whatever its message. Once the image is local the build stops
# depending on the registry: BuildKit finds the manifest and config already in
# the content store, and falls back to the local image when its tag lookup
# fails.
#
# Usage: pull-base-images.sh <dockerfile>...
#   Pulls the images named by FROM lines, directly or through an ARG default,
#   and by `# syntax=` directives. Build stages, `scratch`, the `:local` images
#   this repository builds, and references an ARG only partly expands are left
#   to the build. Images already present are not pulled, so a warm box makes no
#   registry request here.
#
# Env: AVENRA_KIND_PULL_ATTEMPTS (default 5) bounds the attempts per image;
#   AVENRA_KIND_PULL_BACKOFF_SECONDS (default 2) is the first retry delay, which
#   doubles after each failure and gets up to as much again in jitter so the
#   builds that failed together do not retry together.
#   AVENRA_CI_IMAGE_MIRROR (GitHub CI) first takes each image listed in
#   ci/mirrored-images.txt from the repository's GHCR mirror, falling back to
#   its source's pinned digest, and retries only an image both failed to give.
