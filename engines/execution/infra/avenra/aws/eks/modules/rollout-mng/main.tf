# new MNG while sandboxes are being migrated, then is dropped (via
# `cohort_taint_value = null` in a cleanup PR) once the incumbent MNG is empty.
# The taint is declared in the `taint` block so EKS applies it at kubelet
# registration time, rather than via user-data which leaves a
# registered-but-not-yet-tainted window. The cluster-controller's evacuation
# pods carry a matching toleration; steady-state user sandbox pods do not, so
# kube-scheduler will not place user workloads on this MNG while the taint is

  # delta belongs in the *next* workers-N rollout (which provisions a
  # fresh MNG with the new LT), not an in-place roll of the current MNG.

  # have to flow through a new rollout — they cannot be hot-patched via
