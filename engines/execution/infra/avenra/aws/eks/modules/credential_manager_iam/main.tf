# IAM identity for the Avenra credential manager (`avenra-credmgr-svc`).
#
# This module establishes the *workload identity* — the IAM role that the
# credmgr pod assumes via IRSA — and nothing else. No `aws_iam_role_policy`
# is attached here. The owning stack attaches only the scoped storage
# permissions that node services obtain through ExchangeToken; organization
# key access remains at the external branching-key broker.
#
# Deploying this module alone is a strict no-op for the credmgr's runtime
# behavior: the role exists and the SA can assume it, but the role is not
# granted any AWS action. That keeps identity construction separate from the
# reviewed, purpose-specific policies attached by the owning stack.
#
# Cross-cloud note: this is the AWS/EKS implementation. To run credmgr on
# GKE or AKS, the parallel module would live at
# `infra/avenra/gcp/gke/modules/credential_manager_workload_identity/` (or
# the AKS equivalent) and would emit the cloud-appropriate annotation
# (`iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account` or `azure.workload.identity/client-id`).
# The Helm chart consumes `service_account_annotations` opaquely, so no
# chart change is required to support another cloud — only a new module.
