# Server-TLS keypair the avenra-credmgr-authority control-plane Deployment
# presents on its gRPC listener. external-secrets syncs this Secrets Manager
# secret into the `avenra-credmgr-authority-tls` Kubernetes secret (see the
# external_secrets entry in app_deploy.tf), which the Deployment mounts at
# /etc/avenra-credmgr-tls.
#
# The certificate is a self-signed *end-entity* (server) cert — NOT a CA.
# Clients verify the presented cert against this same PEM (passed to them as
# AVENRA_CREDMGR_TLS_CA, which serves as the trust anchor) and match the hostname
# against its SANs. It must not be marked CA:TRUE: the rustls-based credmgr
# client (used by the node credential agent forwarding upstream) rejects a CA
# certificate presented as an end-entity with `CaUsedAsEndEntity`, so
# is_ca_certificate is false and cert_signing is omitted from allowed_uses. cert
# issuance/rotation via cert-manager (the chart's other path) is not used
# because cert-manager is not installed in these clusters.
