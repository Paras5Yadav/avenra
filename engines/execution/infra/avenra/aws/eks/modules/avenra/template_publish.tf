# Workload identity for the deploy-phase template-publish Job
# (charts/avenra-template-publish). Its own role rather than an existing one so
# the Job's blast radius stays its own: the paired ServiceAccount is what
# cluster-api's allowlist authorizes to register releases, and the S3 grant
# below is read-only on this cluster's own bucket.
#
# Deliberately no grant on any other cluster's bucket, and no write grant at
# all: the Job verifies the pinned artifacts are already present and registers
# the release — it copies nothing. The seed rootfs trusts its builder's SSH
# key, so a seed copied from another cluster is one no local build can log
# into, and a fresh cluster builds its own seed rather than importing one.
#
# IRSA rather than Pod Identity to match how every other S3-touching Avenra
# workload authenticates here (credmgr, the worker node SAs): the chart
# annotates its ServiceAccount with the role ARN below.
