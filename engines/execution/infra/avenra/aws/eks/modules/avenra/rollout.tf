# Two-MNG blue/green node rollout: the workers-1 MNG.
#
# The first rollout from the
# legacy `workers-cgnat` MNG adds a `workers-1` MNG via `../rollout-mng`,
# drains cgnat → workers-1 via `scripts/avenra-rollout-mng.py`, then drops
# the cohort taint and (in a dedicated retirement PR) flips
# `workers_cgnat_retired = true` to destroy the legacy MNG.
# The MNG itself is permanent — workers-1 becomes the steady-state worker
# pool once cgnat retires. Future rollouts use the next unallocated workers-N
# index above every permanent worker MNG, including zero-sized capacity groups;
# each adds a separate `module "workers_N"` block in this file with its own
# `workers_<N>_*` per-cohort variable set (re-introduced in the rollout PR and
# dropped on the matching cleanup PR).
#
# Two states a cluster can be in:
#   - Promoted: workers-1 is the steady-state pool
#     (`workers_cgnat_retired = true`).
#   - Legacy (`workers_cgnat_retired = false`): workers-cgnat is still the
#     steady-state worker pool; `workers_1_headroom_count` temporarily
#     instantiates workers-1 during that cluster's rollout.

  # workers-1 exists in two phases:
  #   1. In-flight rollout: the cluster sets `workers_1_headroom_count`, so
  #      workers-cgnat and workers-1 coexist while the orchestrator
  #      drains source nodes onto the tainted target cohort.
  #   2. Steady state: `workers_cgnat_retired = true`, so workers-1
  #      stays alive without the rollout cohort taint.
