# Create Avenra system users. Runs early, before other provisioning scripts.

# Users:
#   deploy — local operator and machine-to-machine automation, gets scoped sudo
#   dev    — local observer/debug access, no sudo
#   avenra-sbxmgr — sandbox manager service account used on worker nodes
#
# Note: this script assumes root. On AWS, packer's execute_command wraps with sudo.

# Note: avenra-sbxmgr is created later in 07-sysctl.sh after the shared Avenra
# groups exist. It gets a self-group (avenra-sbxmgr) as primary, used by
# systemd Group= for DB file ownership. Socket access is controlled by
# explicit chown in service code, not by the process primary group.
