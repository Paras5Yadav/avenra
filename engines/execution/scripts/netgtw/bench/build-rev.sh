# Build the bench harness against one git rev of the gateway library.
#
# The harness links `avenra-runtime-net-gateway`, so "before" and "after" are two
# builds of the same harness source over two revs of that library. The crate did
# not exist at older revs, so a detached worktree is checked out and today's
# crate is copied into it. Only the library differs between the two binaries;
# the workloads, the upstream, and the sampler are identical by construction.
#
# Usage: build-rev.sh <git-rev> <out-dir>
# Writes: <out-dir>/netgtw-bench-<short-sha>-<harness-hash>, reused if present.
#
# The name carries both halves of what the binary is built from. Keying the cache
# on the gateway rev alone would hand back a stale binary after an edit to the
# harness, so a comparison would silently mix two harness versions.
