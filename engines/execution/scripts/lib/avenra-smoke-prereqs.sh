# The kind smoke suites' own prerequisites, and where each one comes from.
#
# These are prerequisites of the suites rather than of the build or the node
# services, and their absence is expensive in two different ways: without lsof
# the shared bootstrap refuses to start a destructive smoke because it cannot
# identify the owner of the localhost API port, and without aws the node-drain
# suite cannot inspect the evacuation's snapshot artifacts in the object store.
#
# `infra/avenra/kind/scripts/install-prereqs.sh` provisions this list and
# `scripts/tests/lib/bootstrap-kind-stack.sh` verifies it before the suites
# run. Keep installation and verification on this shared contract.
#
# Sourced, never executed. Callers need nothing set up first.

# Prerequisites apt carries, named by command. The package name matches the
# command for each of these; a prerequisite whose package differs would need
# that mapping reintroduced here rather than assumed at the call sites.

# The AWS CLI comes from Amazon's bundled installer, not from Debian's `awscli`
# package, because on the devbox image that package cannot be configured at all.
# The image builds some packages through an apt layer that bypasses dpkg, and one
# of them (lcov) left `/usr/share/python3/runtime.d/lcov.rtupdate` behind while
# dpkg has no record of the package. Configuring `python3` runs every rtupdate
# hook; that one calls `py3clean lcov`, which asks dpkg for a file list that does
# not exist, fails with `cannot get content of lcov`, and leaves `python3` in
# `iF`. Every package depending on `python3:any` — `awscli` among them — then
# unpacks but never configures, and `apt-get install` exits non-zero. The
# bundled installer carries its own runtime and depends on no Debian python3,
# so it sidesteps the whole chain rather than waiting on an image fix.

# Packages provisioning needs in order to deliver the prerequisites above,
# rather than tools the suites call: `unzip` unpacks the AWS CLI bundle. Both
# provisioning paths install these. Nothing asserts them as prerequisites,
# deliberately — `aws` present with `unzip` absent is a perfectly good box, and
# `avenra_smoke_install_aws_cli` checks what it needs at the point of use.
#
# `unzip` rather than the `python3 -m zipfile -e` idiom this repo uses for the
# protoc release: that loses file modes, and the bundle it would unpack is a tree
# of executables the installer then copies out, `aws/install` included.
