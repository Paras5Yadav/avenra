# Exercise pull-base-images.sh at the Docker boundary; never touch the host daemon.
#   1. Only registry bases are pulled: FROM lines directly or through an ARG
#      default, and `# syntax=`; stages, scratch, `:local` images, and partly
#      expanded references are left to the build.
#   2. An image already present is not pulled.
#   3. A failed pull is retried whatever its message, and one that keeps
#      failing ends the script nonzero after its attempts, with the error.
