#
# The home for this block, so it stops being copied. Five suites grew their own
# version of it, and a bug fixed in one stayed in the other four — the BSD-`date`
# idempotency key being the concrete case: `%N` is a literal `N` there, so two
# calls inside one second produced the same key, the API deduplicated the
# requests, and a suite silently tested one sandbox where it meant to test two.
#
# Consumers: `smoke-kind-e2e.sh`, `smoke-avenrad-rest.sh`.
#
# Inputs the caller must set before use:
#   API_URL   cluster API base URL
#   auth      bash array of curl auth args (e.g. -H "authorization: …")
#
# Optional:
#   CURL_TIMEOUT_SECS       per-request bound; when unset, `api_curl` is plain
#                           `curl -sS`, so a suite that never had a timeout does
#                           not silently acquire one on adoption
#   AVENRA_OPS_PREFIX        idempotency-key prefix (default: the caller's $0)
#   OPERATION_POLL_ATTEMPTS polls before giving up (default 120)

# Every HTTP call goes through this, so a suite that wants a bound gets it on
# every call site rather than per-invocation. `CURL_TIMEOUT_SECS` unset means no
# `-m`, which keeps adoption behaviour-preserving for suites that had none.

# Unique per call. A collision hollows a run out rather than failing it — the API
# deduplicates the requests — so this avoids `date +%s%N` (a literal `N` on BSD
# `date`), a shell counter (every call site is a command substitution, so the
# increment never reaches the parent), and `$BASHPID`/`uuidgen` (each missing on
# one of the two supported platforms). `$RANDOM` exists in bash 3.2 and
# re-expands per subshell; two draws make a same-second collision ~1-in-10^9.
