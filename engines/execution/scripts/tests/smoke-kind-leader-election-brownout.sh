# Leader-election brownout smoke for the local KinD Avenra stack.
#
# Every other assertion about the cluster-controller's leader election is a unit
# test against a fake lease store. That covers the state machine and none of the
# environment: whether a real apiserver's 403 arrives as the category the policy
# expects, whether kubelet's readiness probe actually observes the marker
# clearing, whether a holder that loses the apiserver resigns before its Lease
# can expire, and whether a replica that spends its liveness budget is genuinely
# restarted by kubelet rather than merely returning a value nobody acts on. Those
# only exist against a live control plane.
#
# What is asserted, in order:
#
#   1. Two replicas, one leader. The `coordination.k8s.io` Lease names one of the
#      two pods, exactly one pod reports winning it, and exactly one pod starts
#      the reconciler set. The last is the safety property the whole mechanism
#      exists for: two concurrent reconciler runners double-drive every CAS loop.
#
#   2. A refused lease call is not a restart. A third contender runs the same
#      image with the `avenra-api` ServiceAccount, which carries the substrate's
#      pod and node RBAC but no `leases` grant — so its substrate builds and
#      every lease call is a 403. It must be NotReady, report the refusal on
#      sight, and *not* restart for twice its liveness budget, while the two
#      healthy replicas keep their leader. This is the behaviour a naive
#      consecutive-failure budget gets wrong: it crash-loops against a
#      misconfiguration no restart can fix, adding a re-LIST of every Node to
#      each attempt. The NotReady half is an outcome check only — see the note at
#      that assertion for why it cannot evidence the clearing path.
#
#   3. An apiserver outage. The control-plane apiserver's static-pod manifest is
#      moved aside, so every replica loses the Lease at once. The holder must
#      resign inside the lease TTL (a standby may take over after it, and the
#      whole cooperative-exclusion argument rests on the holder stopping first),
#      the readiness marker must disappear from a container that demonstrably had
#      one before the outage, and a replica must spend its liveness budget and be
#      restarted by kubelet. After the manifest is restored, exactly one leader
#      and exactly one reconciler runner must come back.
#
# Why the logs are read off the node rather than through kubectl:
#   Scenario 3 takes the apiserver away, so `kubectl logs` is unavailable for the
#   whole window that matters, and the pods restart inside it — which rotates
#   `--previous` past the evidence. kubelet writes each container generation to
#   `/var/log/pods/<ns>_<pod>_<uid>/<container>/N.log` on the node, so the suite
#   reads those through `docker exec`. The pod-to-UID and pod-to-node mapping is
#   captured *before* the outage, while the apiserver can still answer.
#
#   Node-side logs are more durable than `--previous`, but they are NOT a
#   complete history, and the first version of this suite assumed they were.
#   kubelet's container GC keeps only `MaxPerPodContainer` dead containers per
#   container (1 by default), and removing a dead container removes its log file.
#   A run that restarts twice therefore loses generation 0 — which is exactly the
#   generation holding the holder's resignation. So anything that happens to the
#   *first* generation has to be observed while the outage is in progress, not
#   reconstructed afterwards. That is why the resignation assertion polls during
#   the outage instead of reading back at the end.
#
# What this suite does not cover:
#   * The `overloaded` category (429/5xx). Nothing in kind sheds load on demand,
#     and forging a 429 would mean standing up a proxy in front of the apiserver
#     — a different harness, and one whose fidelity claim would be about the
#     proxy. The category's *policy* is unit-tested; its classification is a
#     status-code table.
#   * A partial wedge that spares the substrate but breaks only the lease path's
#     transport. The two share one `kube::Client`, so there is no injection that
#     separates them, and scenario 3's cluster-wide outage is the closest
#     available approximation.
#
#     Observed while building this, because it is the opposite of what `main.rs`'s
#     comment about the substrate reads like: a replica restarted *during* the
#     outage does NOT die at substrate init. `Substrate::from_env` returns before
#     its reflectors have listed anything, so the initial-list failures arrive as
#     `watcher error` warnings on a retrying background task and the process goes
#     on to contend normally. That is why a replica restarted 9s into the outage
#     still spent a full liveness budget and exited on it. Do not write an
#     assertion that depends on the other behaviour.
#

# One program, two modes, because the two things this suite needs from a log are

# the one call site that wanted an epoch *chained* them — parsing the same log
# twice, in two interpreters, on every iteration of a poll that runs while the
# apiserver is down.
