# A drain on the kind bench runs to termination, which deletes the kube Node and
# writes a `node_k8s_tombstones` row; restarting that worker's kubelet brings
# only the kube half back. The leftover row makes placement refuse that node
# forever, so the next create that lands there fails with `409 … is tombstoned`
# — in whichever suite runs next on a shared devbox.
#
# The properties that keep that fixed without weakening the production
# gate, exercised here against the real functions with kubectl and psql stubbed:
#
#   1. The sweep deletes a tombstone whose kube Node is back, and only that one.
#      A node that is genuinely gone keeps its tombstone, which is the gate
#      doing its job.
#   2. The sweep runs under SKIP_BOOTSTRAP=1. That is the mode every devbox run
#      uses once the stack is up, and therefore the only mode in which a
#      previous run's residue is ever encountered.
#   4. A query it cannot run is not an empty result, and a kube API it cannot
#      list is not a cluster without nodes: the sweep fails rather than
#      reporting a clean stack it never actually read.
#   5. A bound statement is fed on stdin, because psql ignores `:'var'` in `-c`.
#   6. The live-cluster mount check runs under SKIP_BOOTSTRAP=1 too. It answers
#      the same question the sweep does — is this cluster carrying a previous
#      run's residue — so it has to run in the mode where that residue is met.
#   7. …and it stands down, rather than failing the suite, when there is no
#      cluster to compare against. That mode read $HOME nowhere before this
#      check existed, and a root-owned ~/.avenra-devbox is a documented shape.
